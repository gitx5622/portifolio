                        <p>Likee was my first project to do with react. 
                            This is a social app which resembled much of 
                            twitter with less functionality as compared. 
                            The app entailed posts where a user can login create 
                            posts after which the post can be liked by others and 
                            can comment on the posts.You can create as many posts 
                            and can be able to views all your posts, likes and comments.
                            Faced some issues with the backend side but still managed to get best 
                            of my expectations.
